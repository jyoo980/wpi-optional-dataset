This repository contains logs and typecheck results resulting from running
the [Checker Framework's](https://github.com/typetools/checker-framework)
[whole-program inference](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#whole-program-inference)
 (WPI) on Java projects.

* `wpi-stdout-logs` contains the results of running WPI iteratively over a
candidate set of annotations generated by type inference.
* `wpi-typecheck-results` contains the results of type-checking with the
Checker Framework's Optional Checker on the final set of annotations generated
by inference.
  * A folder within this directory contains the `typecheck.out` file and a
    `summary.txt` file that summarizes the warnings and errors reported in the
    file.
